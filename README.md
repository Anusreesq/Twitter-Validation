# Twitter-Validation

# Overview

This project focuses on validating the credibility of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The model classifies tweets into credible, non-credible, and neutral categories based on their content. It incorporates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and multiple classification models to achieve its objectives.

# Features

Text Preprocessing:

      Removal of special characters, stop words, and noise.
      Tokenization and stemming to standardize tweet content.
Feature Engineering:

     Vectorization using TF-IDF to convert textual data into numerical features.
Machine Learning Models:

    Evaluated algorithms like:
      Bernoulli Naive Bayes
      Support Vector Machines (SVM)
      K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      Decision Trees
Evaluation:

    Models assessed using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
